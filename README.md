# EIC geometry for eiccodesign

## Installation instructions

Create a directory and install the EIC container there ([installation instructions](https://github.com/eic/eic-shell)). This also sets up a `local` directory where we will install our simulations. Enter the container using `./eic-shell`.

Download and install the IP6 (beampipe) files:
```
git clone https://github.com/eic/ip6.git
cd ip6
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$EIC_SHELL_PREFIX
make install -j8
cd ../..
```
Then download and install this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/eiccodesign/eic_geometry.git
cd eic_geometry
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$EIC_SHELL_PREFIX
make install -j8
cd ../..
```

Then source the setup file:
`source $EIC_SHELL_PREFIX/setup.sh`.
This sets up some variables used in the simulation scripts. 
### You must do this everytime you enter the container!

## Editing the simulation
By default, the simulation includes just the beampipe, the hadron endcap with the HCal (ATHENA: 20/3 mm Steel/Sc), and the HCal insert (W/Sc + Steel/Sc)  Files are included for a homogeneous ECal (`compact/ecal/ecal_forward_homogeneous.xml`), a homogeneous ECal insert (`compact/ecal/ecal_forward_insert_homogeneous.xml`), and the ECCE LFHCAL (`compact/hcal/hcal_forward_ECCE.xml`). 

To change what detectors are simulated, add/remove the desired components in `hadron_endcap.xml`.

Some simple parameters for the geometry are contained in `compact/configuration_default.xml`. If you want to simulate without a beampipe and hole, replace `<include ref="compact/configuration_default.xml"/>` with `<include ref="compact/configuration_nohole.xml"/>` and comment out `<include ref="ip6/central_beampipe.xml"/>` in `hadron_endcap.xml`.

#### NOTE: If you edit any files, you need to `make install` in your build directory before running the simulation.

## Running the simulation
`scripts/run_sim_hepmc.sh` generates a HepMC file and feeds it to npsim and DD4hep. The resulting sim file is then sent through Juggler for digitization, reconstruction, and clustering. The sim and reco files are saved.

To run the simulation, use `$DETECTOR_PATH/scripts/run_sim_hepmc.sh` after sourcing `setup.sh`.

Some basic, adjustable paramaters are listed at the top of `run_sim_hepmc.sh` and the particle type, momentum, and number of events can be fed in with options `-part`, `-p`, and `-n`, respectively. You can change the parameters and then reinstall to transfer the changes to the `local` directory.

The simulation can be run from any directory and the output data will be stored in your current working directory. `scripts/hadron_endcap_reco.py` controls the digitization, reconstruction, and clustering.

There is also `loop_energies.sh` that can be sourced to run the simulation over multiple energies.

#### NOTE: If you remove/add any detector components from the simulation, you must also remove/add the related lines in `scripts/hadron_endcap_reco.py`

## Output
There will be two output files: a sim file and a reco file. The sim file contains the Geant4 level information while the reco file contains the digitized and reconstructed information. Both contain information about the MCParticles. Use the `XHitsReco` branches in the reco files, where `X` is a detector name.

## Addressing Homogenous ECal
To avoid high memory usage, the ECal and ECal insert use a mixed material of W/Polystyrene where the weight percentages are calculated based on the empirical weight and density of a prototype W/ScFi ECal. To incorporate the sampling fraction of the W/ScFi, a smearing procedure is needed: $E_{tower} = \mathrm{gRandom->Gaus}\left(E_{tower}*.03, \sigma\right)$, where $\sigma = E_{tower}\sqrt{a^2/E_{tower} + b^2}$, $a = 0.1$, and $b = 0.0015$. $\mathrm{gRandom}$ here is ROOT's random generator. This maintains the mean of W/ScFi and reproduces fluctuations with a random Gaussian. See [this presentation](https://github.com/rymilton/eic_endcap_insert/files/9172710/Smearing.of.mixture.structure.for.EMCal.pdf) (especially slide 3) by Zhiwan Xu, et al. for more details. -->
